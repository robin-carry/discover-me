# My Notes!

## Your Life's Purpose

After listening to the two great speakers "Robin Sharma" and "Simon Sinek" about the purpose of life, I understand the sense of Purpose. And when I sit and think of it, do I need to define that purpose in life - to be a better father, to be a better employee or just to be a better human being, I come to a path already taken. 

I feel at no one point of time, I understand the destination that well. We all gonna die tomorrow. But am I using the "today" well enough for tomorrow. I will definitely say YES. So to find that purpose, what are the things I should not start today, but keep doing as long as I can:
- Find work which remains passionate; in absense of it, I find stress. 
- Never compromise health over work; never compromise health over money. 
- Stop procastination.
- Reflect on your journey; reflect on these purpose. 

## Habits

First of all the session from Bob Proctor is funny. He wants to help teach people change the paradigm which defines our unconscious mind (what we inherit from our genes). He explains in the session about how to change it, there is a program about it - but at the end he equates results in money eg: "Why your X thoughts will never make you rich?", "Why people who can change their paradigm are earning millions?".

I say it is funny because when I went through the content of Life's purpose, I never once felt the focus of my life's journey is about how much wealth I have or will be. And I am not naive in saying, the absence of wealth is okay for me. For me wealth is a tool to live, not a tool to live comfortably. I will talk more about it in my notes as I grow into the sessions and learnings. 

So the video about changing Habits - I do know some of the "paradigm" which affects me - 

1. Procastination: Lot of us have that.
2. Reactions: I get upset when I see colleague I am working with has not put any effort in understanding the work (done as asked - doesn't care if it is good or bad); _here the conversation is not about what they have done, but how I feel about it_.
3. Limiting Believes: Worrying about my ability to achieve something I haven't even started. _This I have to say, I am making good progress in breaking_.   

## Limiting Believes

1. Fears are larger than the faith 
2. No one will believe in you, unless you believe in you
3. Human being are hardwired for a steady state
4. To be comfortable in the unknown
5. Do everyday one thing that makes you uncomfortable
6. If I need to be free, I got to be me - so I need to know who is "me".

## Zone of genius

Definition of Genius?

And the difference between Genius and Zone of Genius?

Transition from the Compitence, Incompitence & Excellance to the Zone of Genius? 

Do I then think how it affects me and how it reflects on others? 

Just to much food for thought by the above questions and I realize sometimes I have resented when I have lived in my zone of genius; I then try to find something others are good at to feel I am not a genius. Here is what I need to distinguish the difference in the definition. I need to find a path to constantly live in Zone of Genius and not think of being a genius. The difference between the two is space where I am being highly productive, where irrespective of problem being solved or not, I am engaged to the highest level of attention and authenticity.
